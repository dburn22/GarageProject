<h3>Who did the project?</h3>
  This CRUD project was designed, created, and coded by David Burnett. The goal was to implement Graddle with the Spring tools IO IDE.

<h3>What was the project?</h3>
  The goal was to implement C.R.U.D. (Create, Read, Update, Delete), which is one of the most common types of behavior on the web. It represents the states of persistence that almost every web application has.

  <h3>Technologies used:</h3>
  Some of the technologies used in this project were session attributes, @Autowired annotations, as well as learning the latest capabilites of the Spring IO IDE.

  <h3>What future feature sets you would like to add?</h3>
  Some other features I would like to include in my project in the future would be allowing the user to edit more fields. I would also like to create a more user friendly version of the project while focusing on formatting using CSS.
